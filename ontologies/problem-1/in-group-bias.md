# ⚡ In Group Bias

## 1. Literature Review&#x20;

_<mark style="color:green;">Background, Context and Literature State of the Art</mark>_&#x20;

### Wikipedia&#x20;

In-group favoritism, sometimes known in-group bias, is a [Cognitive Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive\_bias) which is a pattern of favoring members of one's in-group over out-group members. This can be expressed in evaluation of others, in allocation of resources, and in many other ways. This effect has been researched by many psychologists and linked to many theories related to group conflict and prejudice. The phenomenon is primarily viewed from a social psychology standpoint. Studies have shown that in-group favoritism arises as a result of the formation of cultural groups. These cultural groups can be divided based on seemingly trivial observable traits, but with time, populations grow to associate certain traits with certain behavior, increasing covariation. This then incentivizes in-group bias.&#x20;

## 2. LLMs

_<mark style="color:green;">Large Language Models</mark>_

### 2.1. General Description

_<mark style="color:green;">A general description of the bias to get an overall idea of the domain</mark>_

In-Group Bias, a prevalent cognitive bias, refers to the tendency of individuals to favor and show preferential treatment towards members of their own social, cultural, or identity group. This bias can lead to the perception of one's group as superior or more deserving than others, often resulting in a range of behaviors such as increased cooperation and empathy within the in-group and, conversely, discrimination or hostility towards out-groups. In-Group Bias is deeply rooted in social psychology, influencing how individuals perceive, interact with, and relate to those they consider part of their social circle.

### 2.2. Examples Scenarios

_<mark style="color:green;">Ten different examples of possible scenarios to understanding the context of the domain</mark>_

1. **Team Collaboration:** In a workplace setting, employees may exhibit In-Group Bias by favoring their immediate team members over colleagues from other departments, leading to increased collaboration within the team but potential challenges in interdepartmental cooperation.
2. **Sports Fandom:** Fans of a particular sports team may display In-Group Bias by perceiving their team as superior to others, resulting in heightened loyalty and camaraderie among fellow fans while potentially fostering rivalry and animosity towards supporters of rival teams.
3. **Social Cliques:** Within a high school environment, students may engage in In-Group Bias by favoring their own social clique, fostering a sense of belonging and shared identity, but potentially contributing to social exclusion and stereotyping of individuals outside the group.
4. **Cultural Preferences:** Individuals may demonstrate In-Group Bias by favoring their own cultural or ethnic group in terms of traditions, customs, and practices, leading to a strong sense of identity but potentially contributing to cultural misunderstandings and biases against other groups.
5. **Nationalism:** Citizens of a country may exhibit In-Group Bias by expressing strong patriotism and favoring their own nation, fostering national unity but potentially leading to prejudices against people from other countries.
6. **Religious Affiliation:** Individuals within a religious community may display In-Group Bias by favoring fellow believers, creating a sense of shared values and solidarity but potentially contributing to religious intolerance and discrimination against those with different beliefs.
7. **Online Communities:** Members of online forums or social media groups may demonstrate In-Group Bias by favoring discussions and opinions within their community, fostering a sense of camaraderie but potentially leading to hostility towards individuals with differing views.
8. **Political Parties:** Supporters of a political party may engage in In-Group Bias by favoring policies and candidates aligned with their party, fostering a sense of political identity but potentially contributing to polarization and animosity towards supporters of opposing parties.
9. **Professional Associations:** Individuals within a professional association may exhibit In-Group Bias by favoring colleagues within their field, fostering collaboration and shared professional interests but potentially contributing to biases against professionals from other disciplines.
10. **Family Dynamics:** Within a family unit, members may display In-Group Bias by favoring their immediate family over extended relatives, fostering a strong familial bond but potentially contributing to tensions and biases within the larger family network.

### 2.3 Main Scenario

_<mark style="color:green;">Considering one scenario; here the</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">**Sports Fandom,**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">as our main user story</mark>_

**User Story:** Exploring Sports Fandom Bias

**User:** Mark, an enthusiastic fan of a local football team

**Objective:** As Mark, I aim to recognize and navigate the In-Group Bias associated with my sports fandom, ensuring a balanced perspective on rival teams and fostering a positive sports community.

**Scenario:** Mark has been a devoted fan of his local football team for years, attending games, wearing team merchandise, and engaging in discussions with fellow fans. Recently, he noticed that his passion for his team has led to a subtle bias against rival teams. During a conversation with a fan of a rival team, Mark found himself dismissing their achievements and underestimating their skills. Recognizing the potential negative impact of this bias on his interactions, Mark decides to explore ways to appreciate rival teams and promote a more inclusive and respectful sports environment.

**Desired Outcome:** Mark strives to maintain his passionate support for his local team while actively challenging any In-Group Bias that may lead to unfair judgments of rival teams. He seeks to celebrate the achievements of all teams, fostering a spirit of healthy competition and camaraderie among sports enthusiasts.

## 3. Frame Semantic Triggers

_<mark style="color:green;">Words as Frame Semantic Triggers</mark>_

To better synchronize the biases with established semantic frames in Framester, we use knowledge extraction tools like [QUOKKA's Concepts Extractor Tool](http://etna.istc.cnr.it/quokka/concepts) and [FRED](http://wit.istc.cnr.it/stlab-tools/fred/demo/).

### 3.1. Starting Lexical Material (SLM),

_<mark style="color:green;">Choosing these Lexical Units, then extracted concepts in QUOKKA's and FRED</mark>_

1. **Fandom:** Refers to the enthusiastic support and admiration of a particular group, often associated with a common interest, such as sports or entertainment.
2. **Cohesion:** Describes the unity and sense of belonging within a group, reflecting the close-knit relationships among its members.
3. **Prejudice:** Signifies a preconceived opinion or bias, often negative, about individuals or groups based on their characteristics, such as cultural background or preferences.
4. **Favoritism:** Implies the unfair preference or treatment of individuals within a group, showing bias towards certain members over others.

### 3.2 Selected Framester F**rames**:

_<mark style="color:green;">Finally, these are the best Framester Frames can be chosen</mark>_

[People](http://etna.istc.cnr.it/framester2/data/framestercore/People)

This frame contains general words for Individuals, i.e. humans. The Person is conceived of as independent of other specific individuals with whom they have relationships and independent of their participation in any particular activity. They may have an Age, Descriptor, Origin, Persistent\_characteristic, or Ethnicity. A man from Phoenix was shot yesterday. She gave birth to a screaming babyyesterday. I study 16-year-old female adolescents. I am dating an African-American man. She comforted the terrified child. I always thought of him as a stupid man.

[Inclination](http://etna.istc.cnr.it/framester2/data/framestercore/Inclination)

Due to internal forces/properties, an Entity is inclined towards a particular Behavior, which may be to perform an action or a to maintain a state. The underlying force is seen as being beyond the Entity's control. The Degree to which the Entity is inclined towards the Behavior may also be specified as well as the Basis for the inclination. My grandmother has criminal tendencies. "Smithers has always had a deplorable tendency to exhibitionism. Chuck was not very inclined to believe me. Smithers has a genetic predisposition for neural tube defects.

[Partiality](https://w3id.org/framester/data/framestercore/Partiality)

This frame has to do with the bias or lack of bias of a Judge making an assessment concerning two or more Sides. The Sides may stand opposed to each other in a dispute or be alternatives in a situation of choice. The Domain in which the Judge is partial or impartial may be expressed as well as the Degree of bias or lack thereof. In sentences in this frame one may also find expressions of Manifestation\_of\_bias, i.e. expressions that tell us how the Judge's bias is realized.

[Categorization](http://etna.istc.cnr.it/framester2/data/framestercore/Categorization)

A Cognizer construes an Item as belonging to a certain Category. In this process, the Cognizer may either passively perceive the Item and note that it fits the Criteria for a Category, or, alternatively, actively examine the Item for certain Criteria that define a Category (or set of Categorys). Most members of the frame can also describe a resulting cognitive state of the Cognizer with respect to the Item and Category which no longer requires the current perception or consideration of the Item. A few LUs (e.g. peg.v, pigeonhole.v) do not readily allow stative interpretation, and a few LUs (e.g. deem.v, regard.v) only allow stative interpretation. You 've already stereotyped me as a bimbo, have n't you?

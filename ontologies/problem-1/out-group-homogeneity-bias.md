# ⚡ Out Group Homogeneity Bias

## 1. Literature Review&#x20;

_<mark style="color:green;">Background, Context and Literature State of the Art</mark>_&#x20;

### Wikipedia&#x20;

The Out Group Homogeneity Bias, is a [Cognitive Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive\_bias) which is the perception of out-group members as more similar to one another than are in-group members, e.g. "they are alike; we are diverse".Perceivers tend to have impressions about the diversity or variability of group members around those central tendencies or typical attributes of those group members. Thus, outgroup stereotypicality judgments are overestimated, supporting the view that out-group stereotypes are overgeneralizations.The term "outgroup homogeneity effect", "outgroup homogeneity bias" or "relative outgroup homogeneity" have been explicitly contrasted with "outgroup homogeneity" in general, the latter referring to perceived outgroup variability unrelated to perceptions of the ingroup.

The outgroup homogeneity effect is sometimes referred to as "outgroup homogeneity bias". Such nomenclature hints at a broader meta-theoretical debate that is present in the field of social psychology. This debate centres on the validity of heightened perceptions of ingroup and outgroup homogeneity, where some researchers view the homogeneity effect as an example of cognitive bias and error, while other researchers view the effect as an example of normal and often adaptive social perception.The out-group homogeneity effect has been found using a wide variety of different social groups, from political and racial groups to age and gender groups.

The out-group homogeneity effect is part of a broader field of research that examines perceived group variability. This area includes in-group homogeneity effects as well as out-group homogeneity effects, and it also deals with perceived group variability effects that are not linked to in-group/out-group membership, such as effects that are related to the power, status, and size of groups. The out-group homogeneity effect has been found using a wide variety of different social groups, from political and racial groups to age and gender groups. The implications of this effect on stereotyping have been noted.&#x20;

## 2. LLMs

_<mark style="color:green;">Large Language Models</mark>_

### 2.1. General Description

_<mark style="color:green;">A general description of the bias to get an overall idea of the domain</mark>_

Out-group homogeneity bias refers to the tendency of individuals to perceive members of a social or cultural out-group as more similar to each other than they actually are, while simultaneously perceiving members of their own in-group as more diverse. This cognitive bias often leads people to oversimplify and stereotype individuals from other groups, assuming that they share common characteristics or behaviors, while recognizing and appreciating the diversity within their own group. This bias can contribute to the formation and perpetuation of negative stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination, as it fosters an inaccurate and exaggerated sense of homogeneity among those considered outsiders.

### 2.2. Examples Scenarios

_<mark style="color:green;">Ten different examples of possible scenarios to understanding the context of the domain</mark>_

1. **Cultural Stereotypes:** A person exhibiting out-group homogeneity bias might assume that individuals from a different country or culture all share the same customs, habits, and values, overlooking the diversity within that out-group.
2. **Religious Assumptions:** Someone with this bias might believe that people practicing a different religion have uniform beliefs and behaviors, ignoring the wide range of perspectives and practices within that religious group.
3. **Political Generalizations:** Individuals may display out-group homogeneity bias by assuming that members of a political party, other than their own, all hold identical views and opinions on various issues, neglecting the internal diversity within that political out-group.
4. **Ethnic and Racial Stereotyping:** People may fall into out-group homogeneity bias when assuming that individuals of a different race or ethnicity share common characteristics or attitudes, ignoring the rich diversity within those groups.
5. **Professional Stereotypes:** This bias can manifest in workplace settings where individuals might wrongly believe that people in a different profession or industry share the same work ethic, skills, or values.
6. **Generational Misconceptions:** A person might exhibit out-group homogeneity bias by assuming that all members of a different generation (e.g., Baby Boomers, Millennials) have the same attitudes or behaviors, overlooking the diversity within age groups.
7. **Educational Stereotypes:** This bias can occur in educational settings when students or faculty members perceive those from other disciplines as having similar intellectual approaches or educational backgrounds.
8.  **Geographic Generalizations:** Individuals might wrongly assume that people from a different region or city all possess similar lifestyles, preferences, or personalities, disregarding the individual differences within that geographic out-group.


9. **Social Class Stereotypes:** Out-group homogeneity bias can lead to the belief that individuals from a different socio-economic class share identical values, habits, or aspirations, neglecting the diversity within that socio-economic group.
10. **Hobby or Interest Stereotypes:** Someone displaying this bias may assume that individuals with different hobbies or interests all have the same personalities or preferences, overlooking the diversity of individuals within those interest-based groups.

### 2.3 Main Scenario

_<mark style="color:green;">Considering one scenario; here the</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">**Educational Stereotypes,**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">as our main user story</mark>_

**User Story:** Sarah, a computer science major, was assigned to **collaborate** on a group project with Alex, a psychology major. Due to her out-group homogeneity bias, Sarah initially assumed that Alex, being from a different academic discipline, would not contribute significantly to the technical aspects of the project. Sarah hesitated to assign Alex tasks related to coding or data analysis, assuming that psychology majors lacked the necessary skills. However, as they progressed with the project, Sarah was pleasantly surprised to discover that Alex had a strong background in statistical analysis and brought a **unique perspective** to the user interface design. This experience challenged Sarah's initial educational stereotypes, highlighting the diverse skill sets that individuals from different academic backgrounds can possess. Ultimately, the **collaboration** not only led to a successful project but also **changed** Sarah's perception of the **capabilities** of students from other disciplines.

### 2.4. Possible CQs

_<mark style="color:green;">Generating some possible competency questions</mark>_

1. _**AgentRole CQs:**_

**Question:** Which agent does play this role?

**Answer:** Sarah, the computer science major.

**Question:** What is the role that is played by that agent?

**Answer:** Sarah assumed the role of a project collaborator and initially held a bias against Alex's contributions based on their different academic disciplines.

2. _**Sequence CQs:**_

**Question:** What's next in the sequence?

**Answer:** Initially assuming that Alex might not contribute significantly, Sarah hesitated to assign technical tasks to Alex. However, as they progressed, Sarah discovered Alex's unique skills and contributions to the project.

3. _**Situation CQs:**_

**Question:** What is the context or situation of something?

**Answer:** The context is a group project where Sarah, a computer science major, collaborates with Alex, a psychology major, bringing together different academic backgrounds for a common task.

**Question:** What are the things present in this context or situation?

**Answer:** In this situation, there's a group project involving collaboration between students from different academic disciplines (computer science and psychology), highlighting the potential for diverse skill sets and perspectives within the team.

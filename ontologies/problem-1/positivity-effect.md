# ⚡ Positivity Effect

## 1. Literature Review&#x20;

_<mark style="color:green;">Background, Context and Literature State of the Art</mark>_&#x20;

### Wikipedia&#x20;

The Positivity Effect, is a [Cognitive Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive\_bias) which the ability to constructively analyze a situation where the desired results are not achieved, but still obtain positive feedback that assists one's future progression.

The findings of a study show that the optimism bias in future-oriented thinking fulfils a self-improvement purpose while also suggesting this bias probably reflects a common underpinning motivational process across various future-thinking domains, either episodic or semantic.&#x20;

## 2. LLMs

_<mark style="color:green;">Large Language Models</mark>_

### 2.1. General Description

_<mark style="color:green;">A general description of the bias to get an overall idea of the domain</mark>_

The positivity effect refers to the psychological phenomenon wherein individuals tend to prioritize and remember positive information over negative information, especially as they age. This cognitive bias influences perception, memory, and decision-making, leading individuals to focus more on positive aspects of experiences or stimuli while downplaying or forgetting negative ones. This tendency is thought to contribute to enhanced well-being in older adults, as they selectively attend to positive emotions and information, which may buffer against the impact of negative events. The positivity effect has been extensively studied in the field of psychology and has implications for understanding how individuals process and prioritize emotional content across the lifespan.

### 2.2. Examples Scenarios

_<mark style="color:green;">Ten different examples of possible scenarios to understanding the context of the domain</mark>_

1. **Memory Bias in Aging:** An older individual attends a family gathering and, despite some disagreements, recalls the event with a focus on positive interactions, such as laughter and shared stories, while minimizing negative aspects.
2. **Workplace Recognition:** An employee receives constructive feedback and criticism during a performance review, but later recalls and emphasizes the praise and recognition given for their achievements, contributing to an overall positive perception of the evaluation.
3. **Travel Experience:** A person goes on a vacation where they encounter some inconveniences, like a delayed flight or bad weather. Despite these challenges, they vividly remember the breathtaking scenery, delicious local cuisine, and positive interactions with locals.
4. **News Consumption:** A news article reports a mix of positive and negative events. Someone exhibiting the positivity effect might remember the uplifting stories while forgetting or downplaying the negative news.
5. **Social Media Engagement:** A user scrolls through social media and encounters both positive and negative posts. The positivity effect might lead them to engage more with, and remember, uplifting and optimistic posts, while filtering out or minimizing exposure to negative content.
6. **Health Diagnosis Coping:** After receiving a health diagnosis, an individual may focus on positive aspects, such as the potential for successful treatment or the support from friends and family, rather than dwelling on the negative implications of the diagnosis.
7. **Learning from Feedback:** A student receives feedback on a project that includes both positive comments and areas for improvement. The positivity effect might lead the student to emphasize the praise, fostering motivation to continue learning, while not being overly discouraged by the areas for improvement.
8. **Relationship Reflection:** A couple discusses a recent disagreement. Despite the conflict, each partner may later remember and emphasize positive aspects of the relationship, such as shared interests, affectionate moments, and mutual support.
9. **Teamwork in the Workplace:** In a collaborative work setting, despite facing challenges and setbacks, team members may collectively remember and highlight the positive aspects of their collaboration, such as successful problem-solving and camaraderie.
10. **Product Evaluation:** A consumer tries a new product that has both positive and negative features. The positivity effect may influence them to focus on and remember the product's positive attributes, such as its convenience and innovative design, while overlooking or minimizing its drawbacks.

### 2.3 Main Scenario

_<mark style="color:green;">Considering one scenario; here the</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">**Learning from Feedback,**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">as our main user story</mark>_

**User Story:** Emma, a passionate and aspiring graphic designer, recently shared her portfolio with a seasoned colleague for review. In the feedback received, Emma was pleased to find positive remarks commending her creative concepts and attention to detail. The colleague, recognizing Emma's potential, provided constructive criticism on refining color palettes for certain projects. Emma, embracing the positivity effect, focused on the praise for her creativity, which bolstered her confidence. Intrigued by the challenge presented in the feedback, Emma delved into further research on color theory and experimented with different palettes. The result was not only an enhanced portfolio but also a deeper understanding of design principles. This experience, rooted in the positivity effect, propelled Emma's professional growth, instilling in her a resilient and optimistic mindset as she continued to navigate the dynamic field of graphic design.

## 3. Frame Semantic Triggers

_<mark style="color:green;">Words as Frame Semantic Triggers</mark>_

To better synchronize the biases with established semantic frames in Framester, we use knowledge extraction tools like [QUOKKA's Concepts Extractor Tool](http://etna.istc.cnr.it/quokka/concepts) and [FRED](http://wit.istc.cnr.it/stlab-tools/fred/demo/).

### 3.1. Starting Lexical Material (SLM),

_<mark style="color:green;">Choosing these Lexical Units, then extracted concepts in QUOKKA's and FRED</mark>_

* Passionate
* Aspiring
* creative concepts
* attention to detail.
* Confidence
* optimistic

### 3.3 Creating the bias ontology file:

_<mark style="color:green;">In the last step, we create the bias ontology in the Protege and also a Graph of it</mark>_

# ⚡ Not Invented Here Bias

## 1. Literature Review&#x20;

_<mark style="color:green;">Background, Context and Literature State of the Art</mark>_&#x20;

### Wikipedia&#x20;

Not invented here bias is a [Cognitive Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive\_bias) which is the tendency to avoid using or buying products, research, standards, or knowledge from external origins. It is usually adopted by social, corporate, or institutional cultures. Research illustrates a strong bias against ideas from the outside. The reasons for not wanting to use the work of others are varied, but can include a desire to support a local economy instead of paying royalties to a foreign license-holder, fear of patent infringement, lack of understanding of the foreign work, an unwillingness to acknowledge or value the work of others, jealousy, belief perseverance, or forming part of a wider turf war. As a social phenomenon, this tendency can manifest itself as an unwillingness to adopt an idea or product because it originates from another culture, a form of tribalism and/or an inadequate effort in choosing the right approach for the business. The term is typically used in a pejorative sense. The opposite predisposition is sometimes called "proudly found elsewhere" or "invented elsewhere".

## 2. LLMs

_<mark style="color:green;">Large Language Models</mark>_

### 2.1. General Description

_<mark style="color:green;">A general description of the bias to get an overall idea of the domain</mark>_

"Not Invented Here Bias" is a cognitive bias characterized by a reluctance or skepticism towards adopting external ideas, products, or solutions, simply because they were not created internally. Individuals or organizations affected by this bias may undervalue or dismiss external innovations, preferring to rely on their own methods or developments. This bias can hinder progress, limit diversity of thought, and impede the adoption of valuable insights from external sources. Overcoming the "Not Invented Here Bias" involves fostering a more open-minded approach that appreciates external contributions and acknowledges the potential benefits of embracing ideas regardless of their origin.

### 2.2. Examples Scenarios

_<mark style="color:green;">Ten different examples of possible scenarios to understanding the context of the domain</mark>_

1. **Software Development:** A tech company dismisses a groundbreaking software solution because it was developed by an external vendor, favoring in-house solutions even if they are less effective.
2. **Research Projects:** A research team refuses to consider external studies or findings in their project, believing that internally generated data and research are inherently more reliable.
3. **Product Design:** An industrial design team rejects incorporating a cutting-edge design concept from an external consultant, insisting on relying solely on their in-house design ideas.
4. **Innovation Competition:** A company ignores an innovative idea presented at an industry innovation event, assuming that internally generated ideas are superior and overlooking potential advancements.
5. **Strategic Planning:** A business organization hesitates to adopt a strategic plan proposed by external consultants, assuming that internally devised strategies are inherently more aligned with their goals.
6. **Marketing Campaigns:** A marketing team disregards an effective marketing strategy developed by an external agency, opting for in-house campaigns that may not be as successful.
7. **Employee Training:** A company rejects an external training program for its employees, assuming that internally developed training modules are more tailored to their specific needs.
8. **Medical Research:** A scientific research team neglects incorporating findings from external studies, believing that internally conducted research is more rigorous and reliable.
9. **Manufacturing Processes:** A manufacturing company refuses to implement a more efficient production process suggested by an external expert, insisting on using their established methods.
10. **Organizational Change:** A company resists adopting organizational changes recommended by external consultants, favoring its own internal approach, even if it may be less effective in the current business landscape.

### 2.3 Main Scenario

_<mark style="color:green;">Considering one scenario; here th</mark><mark style="color:green;">**e Research Projects,**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">as our main user story</mark>_

**User Story: Navigating Not Invented Here Bias in Research Projects**

**User:** Emily, a seasoned researcher leading a team.

**Objective:** As Emily, I aim to foster a more inclusive and open-minded research environment by overcoming the "Not Invented Here Bias" within our team. This bias has led us to undervalue external research findings, hindering our ability to leverage diverse perspectives and innovative approaches.

**Scenario:** During a research meeting, a team member suggests incorporating findings from a relevant external study to enhance the depth of our current project. However, the team hesitates, expressing a preference for relying solely on internally generated data and methodologies. This hesitation is rooted in the belief that internally conducted research is inherently more trustworthy and aligned with our objectives.

**Desired Outcome:** Emily recognizes the influence of the "Not Invented Here Bias" on the team's decision-making process. She encourages open discussion, emphasizing the value of considering external perspectives to enrich our research endeavors. By overcoming this bias, Emily aims to create a collaborative environment where the team appreciates the contributions of both internal and external sources, fostering innovation and comprehensive insights in their research projects.

## 3. Frame Semantic Triggers

_<mark style="color:green;">Words as Frame Semantic Triggers</mark>_

To better synchronize the biases with established semantic frames in Framester, we use knowledge extraction tools like [QUOKKA's Concepts Extractor Tool](http://etna.istc.cnr.it/quokka/concepts) and [FRED](http://wit.istc.cnr.it/stlab-tools/fred/demo/).

### 3.1. Starting Lexical Material (SLM),

_<mark style="color:green;">Choosing these Lexical Units, then extracted concepts in QUOKKA's and FRED</mark>_

1. **Innovation:** The user story involves a bias related to reluctance in accepting external innovations or solutions.
2. **External Contributions:** The story highlights challenges in acknowledging and integrating contributions or ideas from external sources.
3. **In-House Preference:** The bias involves a tendency to favor internally developed solutions over those originating from external sources.
4. **Team Autonomy:** The story suggests a bias associated with a team's inclination to maintain autonomy and develop solutions independently rather than considering external input.

### 3.2 Selected Framester F**rames**:

_<mark style="color:green;">Finally, these are the best Framester Frames can be chosen</mark>_

[Creating](http://etna.istc.cnr.it/framester2/data/framestercore/Creating)

A Cause leads to the formation of a Created\_entity.

[PartInnerOuter](http://etna.istc.cnr.it/framester2/data/framestercore/PartInnerOuter)

This frame concerns Parts of objects that are defined relative to the center or edge of the object. The Part is a part of the Whole and the Part\_Prop describes a property of the Part. She discarded the exterior of the walnut. She preferred a sparse church interior . . In cases where the Target is an adjective, it has a special relationship with the noun that it modifies such that a phrase which is a syntactic argument of the noun is semantically available to fill the argument structure of the adjective, as in "the outside row of the class"The inner shelf of the bookcase was lying on the floor.

[Preference](http://etna.istc.cnr.it/framester2/data/framestercore/Preference)

An Experiencer has a greater desire to participate in some Event, as against another (contextually recoverable) event which exhibits a specific Contrast with the Event. Alternatively, the Experiencer may have a greater desire that some Focal\_participant participate in the Event. The Location\_of\_Event may also be mentioned. Why do women prefer manly faces? I prefer open source programs over proprietary ones. Other customers prefer to send us an order together with a cheque. I prefer my tartar sauce on fish.

[Organization](http://etna.istc.cnr.it/framester2/data/framestercore/Organization)

This frame describes intentionally formed human social groups (here termed Organizations) with some definite structure and Members. They may be relatively informal, consisting only of a group of individuals who are aware of who is and who is not a fellow member, or they may be complex and long-lasting, such as the Roman Catholic Church or the Conservative Party.

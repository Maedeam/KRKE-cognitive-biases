# ⚡ Well TraveledRoad Effect

## 1. Literature Review&#x20;

_<mark style="color:green;">Background, Context and Literature State of the Art</mark>_&#x20;

### Wikipedia&#x20;

The Well TraveledRoad Effect, is a [Cognitive Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive\_bias) in which travellers will estimate the time taken to traverse routes differently depending on their familiarity with the route. Frequently travelled routes are assessed as taking a shorter time than unfamiliar routes. This effect creates errors when estimating the most efficient route to an unfamiliar destination, when one candidate route includes a familiar route, whilst the other candidate route includes no familiar routes. The effect is most salient when subjects are driving, but is still detectable for pedestrians and users of public transport. The effect has been observed for centuries but was first studied scientifically in the 1980s and 1990s following from earlier "heuristics and biases" work undertaken by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky.

## 2. LLMs

_<mark style="color:green;">Large Language Models</mark>_

### 2.1. General Description

_<mark style="color:green;">A general description of the bias to get an overall idea of the domain</mark>_

The "well-traveled road effect" refers to a cognitive bias wherein individuals tend to prefer familiar routes or commonly chosen options over alternatives. This phenomenon is rooted in the human tendency to rely on established patterns and routines, often leading to a preference for options that are more frequently encountered or easily navigated. This bias can manifest in various aspects of decision-making, such as choosing familiar paths in physical spaces, adhering to conventional methods in problem-solving, or opting for mainstream ideas in creative endeavors. The well-traveled road effect reflects the human inclination to seek comfort and safety in the known, even when exploring new possibilities might offer potentially more advantageous or innovative outcomes. Recognizing and understanding this cognitive bias is essential for making more informed and objective decisions that consider a broader range of options.

### 2.2. Examples Scenarios

_<mark style="color:green;">Ten different examples of possible scenarios to understanding the context of the domain</mark>_

1. **Routine Commuting Choices:** People may consistently choose the same route to work or school, even if alternative paths might be quicker or more scenic, due to the comfort of familiarity.
2. **Culinary Preferences:** Individuals may stick to well-known and frequently visited restaurants, avoiding the exploration of new dining options, simply because they are accustomed to the familiar menu and atmosphere.
3. **Professional Decision-Making:** In business, employees or leaders might default to traditional approaches or methodologies, even when more innovative or efficient solutions are available, simply because the established methods feel safer.
4. **Reading Habits:** Readers may consistently choose books from a favorite author or within a preferred genre, missing out on potentially enriching experiences with different styles or genres.
5. **Social Circles:** People might predominantly associate with individuals from similar backgrounds or with shared interests, inadvertently limiting exposure to diverse perspectives and experiences.
6. **Travel Destinations:** Individuals may repeatedly visit the same vacation spots or tourist destinations, overlooking the opportunity to discover new and unexplored places.
7. **Problem-Solving Strategies:** When faced with challenges, individuals might rely on familiar problem-solving methods rather than considering alternative, potentially more effective approaches.
8. **Technology Adoption:** Users may resist adopting new technologies or platforms, sticking to older and more familiar tools, even if newer options offer enhanced features and efficiency.
9. **Educational Choices:** Students might choose conventional majors or courses of study based on societal norms or family expectations, rather than exploring less traditional but personally fulfilling academic paths.
10. **Creativity and Innovation:** In creative fields, individuals may stick to established trends and popular styles, avoiding experimentation with new artistic expressions or unconventional ideas due to a preference for the well-trodden artistic paths.

### 2.3 Main Scenario

_<mark style="color:green;">Considering one scenario; here the</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">**Professional Decision-Making,**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">as our main user story</mark>_

**User:** Emily, a mid-level manager in a technology company.

**Background:** Emily's team is tasked with improving the efficiency of their software development process. The company has been using the same project management methodology for years, and although there have been discussions about adopting more modern agile practices, the team has been hesitant to make the switch.

**Challenge:** Emily recognizes that embracing agile methodologies could significantly enhance their development workflow, leading to faster releases and better adaptability to changes in project requirements. However, the team is accustomed to the traditional waterfall approach, and there's a fear of disrupting the established routine.

**User Story:**

As Emily delves into research about agile methodologies and their potential benefits, she becomes increasingly convinced that it's time for a change. She starts by discussing the idea with her team, emphasizing the advantages of increased collaboration, quicker response to client feedback, and improved overall project transparency. However, some team members express concerns about the learning curve and potential disruptions to their current workflow.

Undeterred, Emily decides to organize a workshop to introduce the team to agile concepts and practices. She collaborates with an experienced agile coach to provide hands-on training and addresses the team's specific concerns. Despite initial skepticism, the workshop proves to be an eye-opener for many team members, showcasing how agile principles align with their goals of delivering high-quality software more efficiently.

Over time, with Emily's leadership and the team's willingness to embrace change, they gradually transition to agile practices. As a result, the software development process becomes more dynamic, leading to faster releases, improved collaboration, and a positive impact on the overall productivity of the team. Emily's decision to navigate away from the well-traveled road of traditional methodologies results in a more innovative and adaptive work environment.

## 3. Frame Semantic Triggers

_<mark style="color:green;">Words as Frame Semantic Triggers</mark>_

To better synchronize the biases with established semantic frames in Framester, we use knowledge extraction tools like [QUOKKA's Concepts Extractor Tool](http://etna.istc.cnr.it/quokka/concepts) and [FRED](http://wit.istc.cnr.it/stlab-tools/fred/demo/).

### 3.1. Starting Lexical Material (SLM),

_<mark style="color:green;">Choosing these Lexical Units, then extracted concepts in QUOKKA's and FRED</mark>_

*   Innovation Dilemma

    &#x20;  \- Explanation: This term encapsulates the central challenge in the user story, emphasizing the tension between the desire for innovation (embracing agile methodologies) and the resistance to change (the dilemma faced by the team in transitioning from traditional methods).
*   Agile Methodologies

    &#x20;  \- Explanation: This term represents a specific set of project management and software development practices that prioritize flexibility, collaboration, and iterative progress. In the user story, it reflects the alternative path from the "well-traveled road" of traditional waterfall methodologies.
*   Proactive Leadership

    &#x20;  \- Explanation: This term refers to the leadership style demonstrated by Emily, the mid-level manager in the story. It encompasses the initiative she took in researching, proposing, and implementing changes to improve the efficiency of the software development process, deviating from the conventional or expected course of action. It contrasts with a more reactive or status quo approach, highlighting the impact of leadership choices on navigating the "well-traveled road effect."

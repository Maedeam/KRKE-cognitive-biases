Diagram for the ontology of Halo effect

## 1. Literature Review&#x20;

_<mark style="color:green;">Background, Context and Literature State of the Art</mark>_&#x20;

### Wikipedia&#x20;

The halo effect (sometimes called the halo error) is the tendency for positive impressions of a person, company, country, brand, or product in one area to positively or negatively influence one's opinion or feelings in other areas. The Halo effect is "the name given to the phenomenon whereby evaluators tend to be influenced by their previous judgments of performance or personality." The Halo effect is a [Cognitive Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive\_bias) which can possibly prevent someone from accepting a person, a product or a brand based on the idea of an unfounded belief on what is good or bad.

## 2. LLMs

_<mark style="color:green;">Large Language Models</mark>_

### 2.1. General Description

_<mark style="color:green;">A general description of the bias to get an overall idea of the domain</mark>_

The "Halo Effect" is a cognitive bias that influences individuals to form a favorable overall impression of a person, product, or entity based on a single positive trait, experience, or characteristic. This positive evaluation creates a metaphorical "halo" around the subject, leading to the assumption that other unrelated aspects or qualities must also be positive. In essence, the Halo Effect occurs when a positive perception in one area extends to influence judgments in unrelated areas, clouding objectivity. This bias can result in overly positive evaluations and skewed assessments, as individuals project their admiration or approval from one specific aspect onto the overall entity, sometimes leading to inaccurate or biased conclusions.

### 2.2. Examples Scenarios

_<mark style="color:green;">Ten different examples of possible scenarios to understanding the context of the domain</mark>_

1. **Interview Impressions:** A job candidate, known for a prestigious accomplishment, is automatically assumed to possess strong leadership skills and expertise in various areas, influencing interviewers to positively evaluate unrelated qualifications.
2. **Celebrity Influence:** Fans of a famous musician may extend their admiration for the artist's musical talent to presume expertise in other fields, like endorsing a product or expressing political opinions.
3. **Physical Attractiveness:** Individuals deemed physically attractive may be unconsciously perceived as possessing positive qualities in areas such as intelligence or kindness, solely based on their appearance.
4. **Company Reputation:** A company renowned for its innovative products might benefit from the Halo Effect, with consumers assuming excellence in customer service and ethical practices, even in the absence of direct evidence.
5. **Academic Achievements:** A student excelling in one subject is often perceived as competent in all subjects, showcasing the Halo Effect in educational settings.
6. **Political Figures:** Supporters of a political figure may attribute competence in various policy areas based on charisma or success in a specific domain, impacting overall political judgments.
7. **Athletic Endorsements:** An athlete's endorsement of a product might lead consumers to believe in the product's quality, even if the athlete's expertise lies solely in sports.
8. **Social Media Influence:** Influencers with a large following may experience the Halo Effect, where their audience assumes expertise in diverse fields beyond their primary content domain.
9. **Charitable Activities:** Individuals engaged in charitable work might be perceived as virtuous in all aspects of their lives, leading to a positive Halo Effect on their character.
10. **Product Packaging:** A well-designed and visually appealing product package may influence consumers to assume superior quality and functionality, creating a positive Halo Effect for the entire product.

### 2.3 Main Scenario

_<mark style="color:green;">Considering one scenario; here the</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">**Social Media Influence,**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">as our main user story</mark>_

**User Story:** Navigating Social Media Influence and the Halo Effect

**User:** Emma, an avid follower of a popular social media influencer, Lily.

**Objective:** As Emma, I aim to critically assess the recommendations and opinions of Lily, the influencer, on various topics, recognizing and mitigating the potential Halo Effect that might influence my judgments.

**Scenario:** Lily, known for her engaging content on fashion and lifestyle, starts expressing opinions on environmental conservation. Emma, impressed by Lily's fashion sense, automatically assumes Lily's expertise in environmental matters, supporting Lily's initiatives without independently evaluating their environmental impact.

**Desired Outcome:** Emma, realizing the potential Halo Effect, decides to delve deeper into environmental issues. She seeks information from reliable sources, ensuring a more informed stance, separating Lily's influence in fashion from her credibility on environmental topics. Emma aims to avoid undue biases and make decisions based on a comprehensive understanding of each subject.

### 2.4. Possible CQs

These competency questions aim to address the roles, sequences, and situations surrounding the user story, providing a comprehensive exploration of the factors influencing Emma's decision-making.

### 2.5. Modelling Bias

_<mark style="color:green;">For making an Ontology and modelling the bias, we can create these classes and properties</mark>_

**Classes:**

* **CognitiveBias**: Represents various types of cognitive biases, including the "Halo Effect." This class serves as a superclass for specific types of biases.
* **BiasType**: Represents different categories or types of biases. In this case, it would include the "Halo Effect" as a specific type of cognitive bias.
* **TargetDomain**: Represents the specific domain or area where the "Halo Effect" occurs. For example, in the scenario of celebrity admiration, the target domain could be the celebrity's expertise outside of their primary field.
* **InfluencingFactor**: Represents factors or traits that contribute to the formation of the "Halo Effect." This could include traits like talent, charisma, or public image.

**Properties:**

* **hasBiasType**: Connects a CognitiveBias instance to its corresponding BiasType instance, indicating that it is a specific type of bias, such as the "Halo Effect."
* **targetsDomain**: Specifies the TargetDomain instance that is the subject of the "Halo Effect" in a particular scenario.
* **isInfluencedBy**: Connects an instance of the "Halo Effect" to the factors or traits (InfluencingFactor) that contribute to its occurrence.
* **resultsInPerception**: Indicates the impact of the "Halo Effect" on perception or judgment. For example, it could represent the perception that excellence in one area implies excellence in unrelated areas.

These classes and properties provide a foundational structure for modeling the "Halo Effect" in different contexts and scenarios. The ontology can be extended or refined based on specific use cases and requirements.

### 2.6. Examples Ontology

_<mark style="color:green;">Three different examples of usage of the Ontology</mark>_

**Example 1: Celebrity Admiration Scenario**

* Instance of InfluencingFactor: "Public Statements"

Properties:

* hasBiasType: Connects "Halo Effect" to "Celebrity Bias."
* targetsDomain: Connects "Halo Effect" to "Environmental Advocacy."
* isInfluencedBy: Connects "Halo Effect" to "Public Statements."



**Example 2: Product Review Bias Scenario**

Class Instances:

* Instance of CognitiveBias: "Halo Effect"
* Instance of BiasType: "Product Review Bias"
* Instance of TargetDomain: "Product Expertise"
* Instance of InfluencingFactor: "Positive User Experience"

Properties:

* hasBiasType: Connects "Halo Effect" to "Product Review Bias."
* targetsDomain: Connects "Halo Effect" to "Product Expertise."
* isInfluencedBy: Connects "Halo Effect" to "Positive User Experience."



**Example 3: Academic Achievement Bias Scenario**

Class Instances:

* Instance of CognitiveBias: "Halo Effect"
* Instance of BiasType: "Academic Achievement Bias"
* Instance of TargetDomain: "General Intelligence"
* Instance of InfluencingFactor: "High Grades"

Properties:

* hasBiasType: Connects "Halo Effect" to "Academic Achievement Bias."
* targetsDomain: Connects "Halo Effect" to "General Intelligence."
* isInfluencedBy: Connects "Halo Effect" to "High Grades."



These examples demonstrate how the defined ontology can be instantiated in different scenarios, such as celebrity admiration, product reviews, or academic achievement, capturing the relationships between classes and properties.

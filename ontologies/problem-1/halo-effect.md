## 1. Background, Context and Literature State of the Art&#x20;

### Wikipedia:&#x20;

The Halo effect (sometimes called the halo error) is the tendency for positive impressions of a person, company, country, brand, or product in one area to positively or negatively influence one's opinion or feelings in other areas.

The Halo effect is "the name given to the phenomenon whereby evaluators tend to be influenced by their previous judgments of performance or personality."

The halo effect is a cognitive bias which can possibly prevent someone from accepting a person, a product or a brand based on the idea of an unfounded belief on what is good or bad.

The term was coined by Edward Thorndike. A simplified example of the halo effect is a person, after noticing that an individual in a photograph is attractive, well groomed, and properly attired, then assuming, using a mental heuristic, that the person in the photograph is a good person based upon the rules of their own social concept.

This constant error in judgement is reflective of the individual's preferences, prejudices, ideology, aspirations, and social perception.

## 2. LLMs (Large Language Models)

### 2.1 - A general description of the bias to get an overall idea of the domain.

The "Halo Effect" is a cognitive bias where individuals tend to form a favorable overall impression of a person, product, or entity based on a single positive trait, experience, or characteristic, which then radiates, or creates a "halo," leading to the presumption that other unrelated aspects or qualities must also be positive. This bias can cloud judgment and decision-making, as it assumes that excellence in one area equates to excellence in others, often resulting in overly positive evaluations and potentially biased assessments.

### 2.2 - Different examples of possible scenarios to understanding the context of the domain

**1- Job Interview Bias:** Imagine a job interview scenario where the candidate arrives impeccably dressed, exudes confidence, and possesses an impressive academic background. The interviewer is immediately impressed by these qualities and, without thoroughly evaluating other competencies, assumes the candidate must excel in all aspects of the job. This is a classic case of the "Halo Effect," where the positive impression from the candidate's appearance and confidence radiates to influence the overall evaluation.

**2- Product Marketing:** In the world of consumer products, a well-known brand introduces a new smartphone model. Due to their past reputation for quality, consumers automatically assume that this new product must also be of high quality in all respects, including camera performance, battery life, and durability, even without thorough research or direct experience. The "Halo Effect" from the brand's history influences their perception of the new product.

**3- Celebrity Admiration:** People often admire celebrities and public figures for their talents or accomplishments in a particular domain, such as acting or sports. The admiration for their expertise can lead to the belief that these individuals are also knowledgeable and credible on a wide range of topics, from politics to nutrition, even when their expertise is limited. The "Halo Effect" in this scenario results from the positive impression of their expertise radiating to areas beyond their actual domain of competence.

# Halo effect

### Definition

The "Halo Effect" is a cognitive bias within the realm of cognitive psychology and social psychology. It describes the tendency of people to form a positive overall impression of a person, product, or organization based on a single positive trait, feature, or experience. In other words, if someone or something is perceived favorably in one aspect, this positive judgment can "radiate" or create a "halo" effect, influencing judgments and evaluations in unrelated areas. This cognitive bias can lead to biased assessments, as individuals may assume that if a person or entity excels in one area, they must excel in others, even when no logical connection exists. The "Halo Effect" highlights how our preconceived notions and cognitive shortcuts can affect our judgment and decision-making processes. It's important to recognize this bias to make more accurate and fair assessments of people and things.

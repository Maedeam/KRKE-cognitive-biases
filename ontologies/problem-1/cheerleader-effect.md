# Cheerleader effect

## Definition

The "Cheerleader Effect" is a social psychology phenomenon that refers to the tendency for people to appear more attractive when they are in a group or surrounded by others than they do when viewed in isolation. This effect occurs because the brain averages the individual features of people in a group, creating a perception of higher attractiveness or desirability than when each person is assessed individually. The term "Cheerleader Effect" is often used humorously, and it suggests that people may seem more appealing when they are part of a supportive or attractive group, such as cheerleaders, but may not be as striking when considered separately.&#x20;

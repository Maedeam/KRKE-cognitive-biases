# ⚡ Reactive Devaluation

## 1. Literature Review&#x20;

_<mark style="color:green;">Background, Context and Literature State of the Art</mark>_&#x20;

### Wikipedia&#x20;

The Reactive Devaluation, is a [Cognitive Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive\_bias) that occurs when a proposal is devalued if it appears to originate from an antagonist. The bias was proposed by Lee Ross and Constance Stillinger (1988). Reactive devaluation could be caused by loss aversion or attitude polarization, or naïve realism.

## 2. LLMs

_<mark style="color:green;">Large Language Models</mark>_

### 2.1. General Description

_<mark style="color:green;">A general description of the bias to get an overall idea of the domain</mark>_

Reactive devaluation is a psychological phenomenon wherein individuals tend to assign less value or importance to proposals, offers, or ideas simply because they originated from an opposing party or individual with whom they have a conflict. This cognitive bias leads people to devalue or dismiss suggestions not based on their intrinsic merit but rather on the source from which they emanate. Essentially, the negative feelings or animosity towards the other party influence the perceived worth of the information or proposals, hindering objective evaluation and potentially obstructing the resolution of disputes or negotiations. Reactive devaluation can contribute to communication breakdowns and impede constructive dialogue in various interpersonal, political, or diplomatic contexts.

### 2.2. Examples Scenarios

_<mark style="color:green;">Ten different examples of possible scenarios to understanding the context of the domain</mark>_

1. **Political Negotiations:** In international diplomacy, if one country proposes a peace initiative, the opposing party might reactively devalue the proposal simply because it comes from their historical rival, leading to a reluctance to engage in meaningful dialogue.
2.  **Workplace Conflicts:** In a corporate setting, if a suggestion for improving workflow originates from a team that has had past disagreements with another department, the second team might dismiss the idea without considering its potential benefits.


3.  **Domestic Disputes:** In a family, if a teenager suggests a solution to a household problem, parents may reactively devalue the suggestion solely because it comes from their child, undermining the possibility of finding a mutually agreeable resolution.


4.  **Legal Negotiations:** During legal negotiations, if one party proposes a compromise, the other side might devalue the offer due to animosity, hindering the progress of the settlement discussions.


5.  **Social Media Debates:** In online discussions, if a person with opposing political views shares a reasonable argument, it might be reactively devalued by those with opposing ideologies solely because of the source, perpetuating polarization.


6.  **Environmental Policy:** When a political group advocates for an environmental policy, individuals from an opposing party might dismiss the proposal simply based on the party affiliation, ignoring the potential positive impact on the environment.


7.  **Educational Reforms:** If a school administration proposes changes, teachers who have conflicts with the administration may reactively devalue the proposals, even if they have the potential to enhance the educational experience for students.


8.  **Scientific Research:** In the scientific community, if researchers from one institution present groundbreaking findings, scientists from rival institutions might reactively devalue the results, impacting the objective assessment of the research's validity.


9.  **Neighborhood Decision-Making:** In a homeowners' association, if a proposal for community improvement comes from a member with a history of disagreements, others might reactively devalue the suggestion, hindering neighborhood progress.


10. **International Trade Talks:** In economic negotiations, if one country proposes a trade deal, the opposing nation might reactively devalue the offer based on past conflicts, impeding the potential for mutually beneficial economic agreements.

### 2.3 Main Scenario

_<mark style="color:green;">Considering one scenario; here the</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">**Social Media Debates,**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">as our main user story</mark>_

**User Story:** Sarah, an avid social media user, comes across a post discussing a contentious political issue. Despite having diverse friends with varying viewpoints, Sarah notices that when her friend Alex, known for having opposing political beliefs, shares a well-reasoned argument in favor of a certain policy change, many mutual acquaintances **reactively devalue** the post solely based on Alex's political affiliation. Sarah, however, recognizing the importance of evaluating ideas on their merit, engages in a constructive conversation with Alex, appreciating the nuanced perspective. Through this interaction, Sarah **encourages** others to consider the content rather than **dismissing** it based on the source, **fostering** a more open and respectful online dialogue.

### 2.4. Possible CQs

_<mark style="color:green;">Generating some possible competency questions</mark>_

1. **AgentRole CQs:**

&#x20;               Question: Who plays a crucial role in fostering a more open and respectful online dialogue in the user story?

&#x20;                 Answer: Sarah, the avid social media user, plays this role.

2. **Sequence CQs:**

Question: What precedes the engaging conversation between Sarah and Alex in the user story?

Answer: The user story mentions that Sarah comes across a post discussing a contentious political issue on social media.

3. **Situation CQs:**

Question: What is the context or situation in which Sarah recognizes the importance of evaluating ideas on their merit?

Answer: The context is a social media platform where Sarah comes across a post discussing a contentious political issue.

## 3. Frame Semantic Triggers

_<mark style="color:green;">Words as Frame Semantic Triggers</mark>_

To better synchronize the biases with established semantic frames in Framester, we use knowledge extraction tools like [QUOKKA's Concepts Extractor Tool](http://etna.istc.cnr.it/quokka/concepts) and [FRED](http://wit.istc.cnr.it/stlab-tools/fred/demo/).

### 3.1. Starting Lexical Material (SLM),

_<mark style="color:green;">Choosing these Lexical Units, then extracted concepts in QUOKKA's and FRED</mark>_

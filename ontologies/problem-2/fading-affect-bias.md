# ⚡ Fading Affect Bias

## 1. Literature Review&#x20;

_<mark style="color:green;">Background, Context and Literature State of the Art</mark>_&#x20;

### Wikipedia&#x20;

The Fading Affect Bias is a [Cognitive Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive\_bias) which is more commonly known as FAB, is a psychological phenomenon in which memories associated with negative emotions tend to be forgotten more quickly than those associated with positive emotions. It is important to note that FAB only refers to the feelings one has associated with the memories and not the content of the memories themselves. Early research studied FAB retrospectively, or through personal reflection, which brought about some criticism because retrospective analysis can be affected by subjective retrospective biases. However, new research using non-retrospective recall studies have found evidence for FAB., and the phenomenon has become largely accepted.

## 2. LLMs

_<mark style="color:green;">Large Language Models</mark>_

### 2.1. General Description

_<mark style="color:green;">A general description of the bias to get an overall idea of the domain</mark>_

The Fading Affect Bias (FAB) is a psychological phenomenon characterized by the tendency of individuals to recall negative emotions associated with past events as less intense over time, while positive emotions fade more slowly or are remembered as more enduring. In other words, people exhibit a bias in the fading of emotional memories, with negative feelings diminishing more rapidly than positive ones. This cognitive bias contributes to a generally optimistic view of one's past experiences, as individuals tend to remember negative events as less emotionally impactful than they actually were, promoting emotional resilience and potentially influencing overall well-being. The Fading Affect Bias has been studied in the context of memory and emotional regulation, shedding light on the complex ways in which individuals remember and process their emotional histories.

### 2.2. Examples Scenarios

_<mark style="color:green;">Ten different examples of possible scenarios to understanding the context of the domain</mark>_

1. **Romantic Relationships:** After a breakup, individuals may remember the negative emotions associated with the end of the relationship as less intense over time, while positive memories of the relationship persist, contributing to a more favorable view of the past.
2. **Academic Challenges:** Students who faced significant stress or anxiety during exams or academic challenges might recall the negative emotions associated with those events as fading faster than the positive emotions related to successful outcomes or personal growth.
3. **Job Loss:** Individuals who experienced the emotional distress of losing a job may, over time, remember the negative feelings and stress associated with unemployment as less intense compared to the positive emotions tied to new opportunities or personal development.
4. **Health Scares:** People who have gone through health scares or medical issues may exhibit the fading affect bias by recalling the fear and anxiety associated with the experience as diminishing faster than the positive emotions related to recovery or resilience.
5. **Financial Struggles:** Individuals facing financial difficulties may, with time, remember the stress and anxiety of economic challenges as less intense, while positive emotions associated with overcoming obstacles or learning financial management persist.
6. **Friendship Dynamics:** After conflicts or disagreements with friends, individuals may exhibit the fading affect bias by remembering the negative emotions associated with the rift as less intense over time, while positive memories of shared experiences endure.
7. **Mistakes and Failures:** People may recall the negative emotions tied to past mistakes or failures as fading faster than the positive emotions related to learning experiences, personal growth, or eventual success.
8. **Family Issues:** Individuals who have faced family conflicts may exhibit the fading affect bias by remembering the negative emotions associated with those conflicts as less intense over time, while positive emotions related to family bonding endure.
9. **Travel Challenges:** Tourists who encountered difficulties during their travels, such as delays, inconveniences, or unexpected events, may remember the negative emotions associated with these challenges as fading more rapidly than the positive emotions tied to enjoyable experiences.
10. **Life Transitions:** During major life transitions, such as moving to a new city or starting a new phase in life, individuals may exhibit the fading affect bias by recalling the initial negative emotions and uncertainties as less intense over time, while positive emotions related to adaptation and personal growth persist.

### 2.3 Main Scenario

_<mark style="color:green;">Considering one scenario; here the</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">**Friendship Dynamics,**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">as our main user story</mark>_

**User Story:** Sarah and Emily, longtime friends, experienced a period of strain in their friendship due to a misunderstanding. Sarah felt hurt and disappointed, and Emily regretted her actions that led to the conflict. As time passed, Sarah found herself recalling the negative emotions associated with the disagreement as less intense. The initial hurt and disappointment gradually faded from her memory, allowing more positive memories of their years of friendship to come to the forefront. One day, prompted by a shared interest, Sarah and Emily reconnected. During their conversation, the negative emotions that once strained their friendship seemed trivial compared to the positive emotions tied to their shared history. The fading affect bias played a role in Sarah's ability to move past the negative emotions, fostering the rekindling of their friendship and a focus on the enduring positive aspects of their relationship.

### 2.4. Possible CQs

_<mark style="color:green;">Generating some possible competency questions</mark>_

1. **AgentRole CQs:**

Question: Who plays the role of the agent in the user story of Sarah and Emily's reconciliation?

Answer: Sarah and Emily are the agents in this story, playing the roles of friends experiencing a period of strain in their relationship.

2. **Sequence CQs:**

Question: What is the sequence of events in the user story of Sarah and Emily's reconciliation?

Answer: The sequence involves an initial disagreement leading to a period of strain, the gradual fading of negative emotions, and a reconnection prompted by a shared interest.

3. **Situation CQs:**

Question: What is the situation or context in which the user story unfolds?

Answer: The situation involves a strained friendship between Sarah and Emily due to a misunderstanding, with the context being a shared history of friendship and the eventual reconnection prompted by common interests.

### 2.5. Modelling Bias

_<mark style="color:green;">For making an Ontology and modelling the bias, we can create these classes and properties</mark>_

**1. Class 1: Emotional Events**

&#x20;  \- Comment: Represents events or incidents that evoke emotional responses. This class can have subclasses to categorize different types of emotional events:

&#x20;     \- Subclass 1.1: Misunderstandings

&#x20;        \- Comment: Instances where there is a lack of clarity or agreement, leading to emotional reactions.

&#x20;     \- Subclass 1.2: Regrets

&#x20;        \- Comment: Instances where individuals feel sorrow or remorse, triggering emotional responses.

&#x20;     \- Subclass 1.3: Positive Experiences

&#x20;        \- Comment: Instances of events or experiences that elicit positive emotions.

**2. Class 2: Relationship Dynamics**

&#x20;  \- Comment: Encompasses the various aspects of relationships between individuals. This class can have subclasses to further detail different aspects of relationship dynamics:

&#x20;     \- Subclass 2.1: Strain Periods

&#x20;        \- Comment: Instances where there is tension or difficulty in the relationship, possibly caused by emotional events like misunderstandings or regrets.

&#x20;     \- Subclass 2.2: Rekindling

&#x20;        \- Comment:\* Instances where a relationship is revived or renewed, often following a period of strain.

&#x20;     \- Subclass 2.3: Emotional Event Influence

&#x20;        \- Comment: Instances where emotional events, whether positive or negative, have a direct impact on the overall dynamics of the relationship

**Properties:**

Property 1: EvokesEmotion

Domain: {Misunderstandings, Regrets, Positive Experiences}

Range: {Emotional Events}

Comment: Relates specific emotional events to the broader category of emotional events.

Property 2: FadesOverTime

Domain: {Emotional Events}

Comment: Describes the temporal aspect of emotional events, indicating that emotional intensity diminishes gradually over time.

Property 3: InfluencesRelationship

Domain: {Misunderstandings, Regrets, Positive Experiences}

Range: {Relationship Dynamics}

Comment: Indicates how emotional events impact the dynamics of relationships, fostering changes in overall relationship dynamics.

**Individuals :** friend

Comment: Represents a specific friend involved in instances of emotional events and relationship dynamics within the Fading Affect Bias context.

### 2.6. Examples Ontology

_<mark style="color:green;">Three different examples of usage of the Ontology</mark>_

**Example 1: Recording Emotional Events**

&#x20;  \- Scenario: Imagine logging emotional events in a diary application. A user, represented as an individual (e.g., "Friend1"), records a positive experience by associating it with the class "Positive Experiences" and capturing the date and time of the event using the "FadesOverTime" property.

**Example 2: Analyzing Relationship Dynamics**

&#x20;  \- Scenario: A relationship counseling application analyzes relationship dynamics over time. Instances of "Strain Periods" and "Rekindling" are linked to specific friends (individuals) through the "InfluencesRelationship" property. The application visualizes how emotional events impact the overall dynamics of friendships.

**Example 3: Predicting Emotional Event Influence**

&#x20;  \- Scenario: An emotional well-being prediction system uses historical data to predict how certain emotional events, represented as instances of "Emotional Event Influence," might influence relationships. The system considers the "FadesOverTime" property to understand the temporal aspect of emotional events.

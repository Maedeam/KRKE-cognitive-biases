# ⚡ Negativity Bias

## 1. Literature Review&#x20;

_<mark style="color:green;">Background, Context and Literature State of the Art</mark>_&#x20;

### Wikipedia&#x20;

The Negativity Bias is a [Cognitive Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive\_bias) which is also known as the negativity effect, is a cognitive bias that, even when of equal intensity, things of a more negative nature (e.g. unpleasant thoughts, emotions, or social interactions; harmful/traumatic events) have a greater effect on one's psychological state and processes than neutral or positive things.In other words, something very positive will generally have less of an impact on a person's behavior and cognition than something equally emotional but negative. The negativity bias has been investigated within many different domains, including the formation of impressions and general evaluations; attention, learning, and memory; and decision-making and risk considerations.

## 2. LLMs

_<mark style="color:green;">Large Language Models</mark>_

### 2.1. General Description

_<mark style="color:green;">A general description of the bias to get an overall idea of the domain</mark>_

Negativity bias is a psychological phenomenon wherein individuals tend to give more significance to and recall negative events or information more readily than positive ones. This cognitive bias suggests that humans are inherently more sensitive to adverse stimuli, possibly as an evolutionary adaptation that favored survival by prioritizing the detection of potential threats. Consequently, people often exhibit a heightened attention, stronger emotional reactions, and better memory retention for negative experiences compared to positive ones. Negativity bias can impact various aspects of decision-making, social interactions, and overall emotional well-being, as individuals may disproportionately focus on and be influenced by negative aspects of situations or information.

### 2.2. Examples Scenarios

_<mark style="color:green;">Ten different examples of possible scenarios to understanding the context of the domain</mark>_

**1. Performance Evaluation:** An employee receives a performance review that includes mostly positive feedback, but there's one constructive criticism. Despite the numerous positive comments, the individual fixates on the single negative aspect, potentially overshadowing their overall achievements.

**2. Social Media Comments:** A person posts a photo receiving numerous compliments and positive comments. However, a single negative remark catches their attention, causing disproportionate distress and potentially leading them to dwell on the criticism rather than the praise.

**3. News Consumption:** A news report highlights several positive developments alongside a single negative incident. Viewers or readers are more likely to remember and be affected by the negative event, potentially leading to a skewed perception of the overall situation.

**4. Relationships:** In a relationship, one critical comment during an otherwise positive interaction can linger in the minds of individuals, leading to an exaggerated perception of the negativity within the relationship.

**5. Consumer Reviews:** A product receives numerous positive reviews, but a few negative comments stand out to potential buyers, influencing their decision-making more than the overall positive feedback.

**6. Public Speaking:** A speaker delivers a compelling presentation with valuable content, but the audience remembers one awkward moment or mistake, leading to a distorted perception of the speaker's overall competence.

**7. Team Collaboration:** A team successfully completes a project, but the team members focus on the one challenging aspect or conflict, potentially hindering their ability to appreciate the overall success and collaboration.

**8. Personal Goals:** An individual sets multiple personal goals and achieves most of them, but the failure to accomplish one goal becomes a primary focus, overshadowing the sense of accomplishment from the other achievements.

**9. Body Image:** Despite numerous compliments on physical appearance, an individual fixates on a single perceived flaw, contributing to negative self-perception and potentially impacting their overall self-esteem.

**10. Educational Feedback:** A student receives positive feedback on an assignment but becomes preoccupied with one critical comment from the instructor, potentially undermining their confidence and discouraging further efforts.

### 2.3 Main Scenario

_<mark style="color:green;">Considering one scenario; here the</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">**Consumer Reviews,**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">as our main user story</mark>_

**User Story:** Sarah, an avid online shopper, is in search of a new laptop for her graphic design work. She comes across a model with an overall positive rating and glowing reviews about its speed, display quality, and durability. As she delves into the reviews, she stumbles upon one critique mentioning a potential compatibility issue with certain design software. Despite the numerous positive comments, Sarah becomes fixated on this single negative review, as her work heavily relies on graphic design tools. The negativity bias influences her decision, and she hesitates to proceed with the purchase, concerned that the laptop might not meet her specific software requirements. This user story highlights how a singular negative comment can disproportionately impact the perception of a product, even in the presence of overwhelmingly positive feedback.

### 2.5. Modelling Bias

_<mark style="color:green;">For making an Ontology and modelling the bias, we can create these classes and properties</mark>_

1. **Class: UserPerceptionAnalysis:** _The overarching class representing the analysis of user perception, encompassing various factors such as cognitive processes, emotional responses, and review analysis._
2. **Class: CognitiveProcesses:** _A subclass of UserPerceptionAnalysis that focuses on mental processes involved in information perception and processing._
3. **Class: DecisionMakingProcess:** _Comment: A subclass of CognitiveProcesses representing the cognitive steps individuals take when making choices, influenced by factors including the Negativity Bias._
4. **Class: EmotionalResponse:** _A subclass of UserPerceptionAnalysis representing emotional reactions individuals may experience, including heightened emotional responses influenced by the Negativity Bias._
5. **Subclass: EmotionalDistress:** _A subclass of EmotionalResponse that specifically denotes heightened emotional responses, such as DisproportionateDistress._
6. **Class: InformationFocus:** _A subclass of UserPerceptionAnalysis representing the selective attention individuals exhibit, as seen in Fixation on specific information._
7. **Class: ReviewAnalysis:** _Comment: A subclass of UserPerceptionAnalysis representing the examination of reviews, including AdverseEvaluation, as part of the cognitive processes influenced by the Negativity Bias._
8. **Class: AdverseEvaluation:** _Comment: A subclass of UserPerceptionAnalysis representing a review or evaluation that emphasizes negative aspects of a subject, serving as a stimulus for the activation of the Negativity Bias._
9. **Class: ReviewerRole:** _A subclass of UserPerceptionAnalysis representing the role of individuals who provide reviews, influencing the ReviewAnalysis process._
10. **Individual: Reviewer:** _An individual representing the role of a person who contributes reviews, influencing the overall review analysis and potentially contributing to the activation of the Negativity Bias._

* _Domain: UserPerceptionAnalysis_
* _Range: CognitiveProcesses_
* _Comment: Describes the relationship between the UserPerceptionAnalysis class and the cognitive processes it influences, such as the DecisionMakingProcess._

12. **Property: experiencedEmotion**

* _Domain: EmotionalResponse_
* _Range: EmotionalDistress_
* _Comment: Describes the relationship between the EmotionalResponse class and the specific emotional distress individuals may experience._

13. **Property: focusesOn**

* _Domain: UserPerceptionAnalysis_
* _Range: InformationFocus_

* _Comment: Describes the relationship between the ReviewerRole class and the specific reviews they provide, which may include AdverseEvaluations._

### 2.6. Examples Ontology

_<mark style="color:green;">Three different examples of usage of the Ontology</mark>_

**Example 1: User Decision-Making Process Analysis**

Scenario: A company is analyzing user feedback on a new software product. They use the ontology to understand the DecisionMakingProcess and CognitiveProcesses involved in users' decision-making.

In this example, an individual UserFeedback1 provides an AdverseEvaluation, representing a negative review. The ReviewAnalysis of this feedback influences the DecisionMakingProcess, allowing the company to understand how negative reviews impact user decisions.

**Example2: Emotional Response Tracking**

Scenario: A researcher is conducting a study on emotional responses to online content. They utilize the EmotionalResponse class and its subclasses to categorize and analyze emotional reactions.

In this instance, an individual OnlineContent is analyzed using the EmotionalResponse subclass, specifically DisproportionateDistress. User1 is an example of an individual experiencing disproportionate distress in response to the online content.

**Example3: Reviewer Role Influence**

Scenario: An e-commerce platform wants to understand how different types of reviewers contribute to the perception of products. They use the ontology to model the relationship between ReviewerRole, providesReview, and AdverseEvaluation.

In this scenario, a specific ProductReview1 is categorized as an AdverseEvaluation, and it is provided by an individual with the role of ProfessionalReviewer, who belongs to the ReviewerRole class. This allows the e-commerce platform to analyze how reviews from professional reviewers influence the overall perception of a product.

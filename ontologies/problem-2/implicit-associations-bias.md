# ⚡ Implicit Associations Bias

## 1. Literature Review&#x20;

_<mark style="color:green;">Background, Context and Literature State of the Art</mark>_&#x20;

### Wikipedia&#x20;

The implicit-association test (IAT) is an assessment intended to detect subconscious associations between mental representations of objects (concepts) in memory. Its best-known application is the assessment of implicit stereotypes held by test subjects, such as associations between particular racial categories and stereotypes about those groups. The test has been applied to a variety of belief associations, such as those involving racial groups, gender, sexuality, age, and religion but also the self-esteem, political views, and predictions of the test taker. The implicit-association test is the subject of significant academic and popular debate regarding its validity, reliability, and usefulness in assessing implicit bias which is a [Cognitive Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive\_bias).

## 3. Frame Semantic Triggers

_<mark style="color:green;">Words as Frame Semantic Triggers</mark>_

To better synchronize the biases with established semantic frames in Framester, we use knowledge extraction tools like [QUOKKA's Concepts Extractor Tool](http://etna.istc.cnr.it/quokka/concepts) and [FRED](http://wit.istc.cnr.it/stlab-tools/fred/demo/).

### 3.1. Starting Lexical Material (SLM),

_<mark style="color:green;">Choosing these Lexical Units, then extracted concepts in QUOKKA's and FRED</mark>_

### 3.3 Creating the bias ontology file:

_<mark style="color:green;">In the last step, we create the bias ontology in the Protege and also a Graph of it</mark>_

{% hint style="success" %}

## 4. Selected Content Ontology Design Patterns

[**AgentRole**](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:AgentRole)

To represent agents and the roles they play.

**Reusable OWL Building Block:** [http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/agentrole.owl](http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/agentrole.owl)

[**Sequence**](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:Sequence)

To represent sequence schemas. It defines the notion of transitive and intransitive precedence and their inverses.

It can then be used between tasks, processes, time intervals, spatially locate objects, situations, etc.

[**AffectedBy**](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:AffectedBy)

To represent properties/qualities that may affect the status of a feature of interest.

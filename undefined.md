**User Story:** "Sarah, a politically active individual, had a strong confirmation bias towards a particular political party. She avidly followed news sources and social media accounts that shared views aligned with her party's ideology. One day, Sarah came across an article that presented a different perspective on a key issue. Despite the article being well-researched and providing evidence to support its claims, Sarah immediately dismissed it as biased and inaccurate, due to her confirmation bias. She shared the article with her friends, highlighting the parts that confirmed her pre-existing beliefs, reinforcing their shared biases.”&#x20;

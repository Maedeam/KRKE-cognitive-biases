# ðŸ§— Workflow

**1.** Start by familiarizing with the context and conducting a literature review to understand the domain we are working with.

**2.** Leverage large language models to assist in ontology development, such as generating suggestions or extracting relevant information from textual sources.

**3.** Identify and utilize existing ontology design patterns (ODPs) that align with your modeling requirements. These patterns provide guidance and promote consistency.

**4.** Identify specific words or terms that can serve as triggers for frame semantics, allowing us to map them to relevant frames within your ontology.

**5.** Integrate newly created ontology modules into the overall structure and ensure alignment and compatibility with existing modules or ontologies.

By incorporating the CLOWN Modeling framework into the XD methodology, we can benefit from a structured approach to ontology development that leverages existing knowledge, ontology design patterns, and semantic triggers, ultimately leading to a well-designed and coherent ontology.

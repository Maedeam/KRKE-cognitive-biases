With this little part poem, we start our project with the goal of modelling two different clusters of biases taken from the classification made by [_Buster Benson_](https://buster.wiki/), posted at this [_Medium post._](https://betterhumans.pub/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18)

## üóÇ Benson Classification

[_Buster Benson_](https://buster.wiki/) in his [_Medium post_](https://betterhumans.pub/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18) categorise all biases in 20 unique mental strategies that we use for specific reasons and then put each cluster of these biases into 4 different general mental problems category, that we can see all in details in this awesome diagram:

\
The 4 general mental problems are:

1. "What should we remember?"
2. "Too much information"
3. "Not enough meaning"
4. "Need to act fast"

## üìç About our two clusters

By knowing these 4 general mental problems, we choose this two clusters of biases respectfully from the two different mental problems of "Not enough meaning" and "What should we remember?" :

* **We imagine things and people we‚Äôre familiar with or fond of as better than things and people we aren‚Äôt familiar with or fond of.**
* **We discard specifics to form generalities.**

{% hint style="info" %}
Now, we deep into our two clusters by details one by one.
{% endhint %}

### **1- We imagine things and people we‚Äôre familiar with or fond of as better than things and people we aren‚Äôt familiar with or fond of.**

Similar to some other clusters, but the filled-in bits generally also include built in assumptions about the quality and value of the thing we‚Äôre looking at.

This includes:

* [_Halo effect_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo\_effect)
* [_In-group bias_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-group\_favoritism)
* [_Not invented here_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not\_invented\_here)
* [_Cross-race effect_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-race\_effect)
* [_Cheerleader effect_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheerleader\_effect)
* [_Well-traveled road effect_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well\_travelled\_road\_effect)
* [_Out-group homogeneity bias_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-group\_homogeneity)
* [_Reactive devaluation_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive\_devaluation)
* [_Positivity effect_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivity\_effect)

### **2- We discard specifics to form generalities.**

We do this out of necessity, but the impact of implicit associations, stereotypes, and prejudice results in some of the most glaringly bad consequences from our full set of cognitive biases.

This includes:

* [_Fading affect bias_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fading\_affect\_bias)
* [_Negativity bias_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity\_bias)
* [_Prejudice_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice)
* [_Stereotypical bias_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit\_stereotype)
* [_Implicit stereotypes_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit\_stereotype)
* [_Implicit associations_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit\_stereotype)
